===============
thecut.ordering
===============

To install this application (whilst in the project's activated virtualenv)::
    pip install git+ssh://git@git.thecut.net.au/thecut-ordering


If you are using the admin reordering mixin, then add ``thecut.ordering`` to
the project's ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting, so that the required static files are
found::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'thecut.ordering',
    )
